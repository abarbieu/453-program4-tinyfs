How well our tinyFS works:

Our tinyFS seems to work as well as we could hope, no tests for performance were done, though compared
to a real file system we would expect it to do somewhat worse, though at most scales this probably
wouldn't be noticeable

One comment is that, in all our tests, our files were quite small, and as such most of our memory was
being used to keep track of them and our inodes contained a large amount of empty space.

Additional functionality:

We implemented permissions (read vs read-write) including byte-level writingand directory listing with
file renaming. At the bottom of our demo file we have a section dedicated for these features.

Limitations and Bugs:

Currently the maximum file size is larger than the total memory (65k vs 10k), though if no free blocks
are available for a file an error will be returned. Another limitation is the lack of an interface for
dealing with different data types. For example, storing file names for our root directory involved manual
decoding of byte-level string information.
